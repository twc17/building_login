# 
# Purpose:
#   This is a program for a building access log book. It uses a magnetic card reader to grab
#   a Pitt employees 2P number from their ID card. This will then be used for an LDAP query to
#   get the rest of their account information. You also have the option to manually enter in 
#   information for guests, or if you forgot your ID card.
#
# Usage:
#   python [-h] building_login.py
